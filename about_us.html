            <p>
                Noods To Go was founded in December of 2019, when four friends came up with the dream of 
                delicious noodles delivered to your home whenever you want - no hassle, only noods. We 
                set out to create the best noodle shop in Boston, using only the freshest ingredients 
                and recipes refined to be the best, most flavorful homemade noodles you'll ever have. 
            </p>
            <p>
                We pride ourselves in taking care of our customers - we knew how important it was to make 
                sure our web app technology facilitates the best customer experience. Now, customers are 
                able to have the best noodles in Boston delivered straight to their doorsteps with the 
                click of a button. Now, we have 9 different locations spanning 4 different continents!
            </p>
            <p>
                Noodles are our specialty, our passion, our life. Noodles transcend cultures and divisions.
                We believe in using food to spread compassion and community. Not only do we incorporate 
                different cuisines to create a more inclusive menu, we also source from local suppliers  
                to support community members of various cultures, and we have a diverse and community-based 
                leadership team. We uplift, support, feature, and love our community through the power
                of noods.
